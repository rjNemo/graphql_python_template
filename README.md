# 🐍 Python GraphQL API 

Python GraphQL API template application.

It's a multi user TODO list application with a clean architecture implementation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### 💼 Prerequisites

You need: 
- `Python 3` installed on your local machine. You will find installation steps for your platform on the
 python [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- I recommend `pipenv` for virtual environment setup.

### 🖥 Installing

Clone the project.

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies with:
```shell script
pipenv install
```

Activate the virtual environment with:
```shell script
pipenv shell
```

Then launch the development server using:
```shell script
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
The development server and GraphiQL API explorer are available on  http://0.0.0.0:8000. 

🎉 Enjoy!
